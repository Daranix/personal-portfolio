Personal porfolio website using Astro & Vue for the form

## ‚ùî FAQ

- Why did you use Astro for create it?

Because It is a simple framework that allows SSG and SSR. In addition, when I started the portfolio I was not sure if I would use Vue or React for the contact form, Astro gave me the flexibility to use whichever one I wanted when the time came.

- You're talking about SSG but now all the content is SSR ... 

That's totally true, but the reason is that I haven't figured out (yet) how to handle translations to be SSG. Previously, for a web version of my CV I used a library but I was not happy with it. With Astro 4 they supposedly introduced tooling for i18n and I was hoping the framework would have some way to do the SSG pages on build, but after reading the documentation it seems like you either do the page 2 times in the respective languages. If you want the page to be static, for now the server processes everything to translate, it is not a big problem because the content does not change too much and can be easily fixed by adding a caching system
